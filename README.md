# How to run the tests.

First, open a new tab on your terminal, go to the `my-new-sample-app` folder and do an `npm install` to install every dependency on the project.

On the same tab, run the command `npm run start` to start the React application in your localhost.

Then, open another tab and run cypress in open mode: `npm run open`, run the spec and enjoy!
